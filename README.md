# Purpose
This project was completed using javascript and HTML through VSCODE.
The main purpose was to visualize the findings of a research that was done to conclude that human beings are produce bacteria species that taste like beef which if explored well can be valuable for a the food start up she will be working with.

We have created a dashboard that allow lab researchers to expose their findings based on the id numbers of our test subjects
# Outcome

Please [click here](https://fofomichelle.github.io/plotlydiploy/) to visualize the final look of the dashboard created 
On the webpage you can visualize 3 graphs:
- a bar chart
- bubble chart
- gauge chart
As we choose the id number of our test subjects the 3 of them will update to show respectively : demographic info, the top 10 bacteria cultures as well as the belly button washing frequency.
This will help the food start up company as well as the test subjects to visualize our findings.
